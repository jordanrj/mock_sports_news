Mock website and serverside form processor.

Server file (app.js) uses nodejs and express, along with npm packages for form validation and path standardization.

Both views use css for styling and interaction, with javascript used only for toggling the navbar when the menu button is clicked in mobile views.

Please note that the server will not actually connect to a database and will not render the views due to a resolution issue with paths when launching views locally vs with a server.  Since the server will not connect to the database anyway, I decided to leave the link paths working for local interaction instead.
